== Description ==

Build websites selling travel products online.

This plugin extends WordPress with new Post types for Tours/Hotels (and other travel products) and integrates with the TourCMS booking engine. Upload your prices once, ensure you are always displaying live pricing and booking against live availability. 

Includes widgets for displaying products on Google Maps or showing an availability overview and a specially designed theme is available free of charge from our website (or use your existing theme).

Store complex pricing, availability, bookings and customer data secure in [TourCMS](http://www.tourcms.com "TourCMS"). Use WordPress to design and build your website, seamlessly integrating with TourCMS for the booking/enquiry process.

The TourCMS booking engine is configurable in 14+ languages (let us know if you need one we don't currently support) and integrates with various payment gateway solutions from around the world.

**This plugin requires a paid [TourCMS](http://www.tourcms.com "TourCMS") account, free trial accounts are available**
