Integrate WordPress with TourCMS to aid creating specialist Tour and Activity Operator websites.

== Description ==

Integrate WordPress with [TourCMS](http://www.tourcms.com "TourCMS") to aid creating Tour & Activity Operator websites.

This plugin extends WordPress with new Post types for Tours (and other travel products) and integrates with the TourCMS booking engine. Upload your prices once (into TourCMS) and ensure you are always displaying live pricing and booking against live availability. 

Includes widgets for displaying products on Google Maps or showing a monthly availability overview and a basic example theme can be downloaded from our website (or customise your existing theme).

Store complex pricing, availability, bookings and customer data secure in TourCMS. Use WordPress templates to design and build your website, integrating with TourCMS for the booking/enquiry process.

The TourCMS booking engine is configurable in 20+ languages (let us know if you need one we don't currently support) and integrates with various payment gateway solutions from around the world.

**This plugin requires a paid [TourCMS](http://www.tourcms.com "TourCMS") account, free trial accounts are available**

If you have any feedback or queries we'd love to hear from you so please drop by the [TourCMS forums](http://community.tourcms.com "TourCMS forums") or [Send us a message](http://www.tourcms.com/company/contact.php "Send us a message").

Please do feel free to contact us prior to starting your project, we have other website integration options, matching all developer skill-sets.
